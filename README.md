This project focuses on developing a predictive system using machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign. By leveraging the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which includes numerous features related to breast cancer patients, the project aims to enhance early detection and assist in medical decision-making. The process involved a comprehensive workflow: starting with importing necessary Python libraries, followed by reading and analyzing the dataset. Preprocessing steps, including data splitting and scaling, were applied to prepare the data for modeling. Several machine learning algorithms were then developed, trained, and evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision. A comparative analysis was conducted to identify the best-performing model, which was then used for predictive analysis. This project ultimately contributes to the goal of improving breast cancer diagnosis by determining the most accurate predictive model.
